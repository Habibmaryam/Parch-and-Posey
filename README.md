# Project goal and objectives
The goal of this project is to give us practical experience obtainable in a business environment as a data analyst. The main idea is to encourage ease in analytical thinking for insight preparation.
Here, I will be looking at the Parch and Posey data set where I will be generating insights about sales.
Before generating the insights, I was able to import the Parch and Posey data set into my PostgreSQL database. After importing my data, I ensured that there were no NULL values (empty cells) in the data set to prevent errors while generating insights.
I began to generate insights that were related to sales, regions, and sales representatives to have an idea of the most sales using different combinations. In the end, I generated up to 17 insights using SQL.
Furthermore, I imported my data set from PostgreSQL to my power and began creating visualizations. I created 8 visuals on Power BI. Before proceeding to create visuals on Power BI, I created an enterprise relational database to connect all the primary and foreign keys of the Parch and Posey tables. Then I saved it once I was done with visuals and formatting.

# Obejctives
Finding the sales that occurred throughout four years (2013-2017) to monitor the rise and fall of the sales revenue at Parch and Posey. I thought that monitoring the sales that occurred throughout the year would give an idea of which year sold the highest.
To analyze the most used channel to identify the needs of orders by the customers. Here, I am aware that there are different strokes for different folks, hence, the reason why I wanted to generate an insight into the most used channel. This assists Parch and Posey in determining which channel should be their main focus.
To identify the region with the most sales to know which region to concentrate more on when Parch and Posey consider the option of increasing their reach across regions. If Parch and Posey decide, for instance, to create more awareness, the region with low sales might as well translate to one with low reach.
To single out the most used channel that customers are more comfortable with when they intend to make purchases.
To identify sales reps with the most sales. The marketing manager of Parch and Posey will be keen to know which of their sales rep deserves a bonus based on merit which is most sales.
