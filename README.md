# Project goal and objectives
The goal of this project is to give us practical experience obtainable in a business environment as a data analyst. The main idea is to encourage ease in analytical thinking for insight preparation.
Here, I will be looking at the Parch and Posey data set where I will be generating insights about sales.
Before generating the insights, I was able to import the Parch and Posey data set into my PostgreSQL database. After importing my data, I ensured that there were no NULL values (empty cells) in the data set to prevent errors while generating insights.
I began to generate insights that were related to sales, regions, and sales representatives to have an idea of the most sales using different combinations. In the end, I generated up to 17 insights using SQL.
Furthermore, I imported my data set from PostgreSQL to my power and began creating visualizations. I created 8 visuals on Power BI. Before proceeding to create visuals on Power BI, I created an enterprise relational database to connect all the primary and foreign keys of the Parch and Posey tables. Then I saved it once I was done with visuals and formatting.
